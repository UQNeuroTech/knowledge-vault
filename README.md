# Vault
Here lies the internal internet of UQ NeuroTech, the "Knowledge Vault". You will find here a collection of markdown files, images, and pdf documents that record the important insights of the club. This is intended to be maintained and added to by club-executives, and club members, and especially the UQ NeuroTech development team. 

## Introduction

All information in the vault is stored in plain-text (.md) files. 
Therefore, in theory, you can access the information directly by clicking on the files here in github - or using any text editor of your choosing if you download the repository. 

However, to get the most out of the vault, we strongly recommend usign the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) program. This is the program that the vault was designed to be opened, and modified with. 

## Vault "Installation" instructions

1. Install Git on your computer
Ensure Git is installed on your system. Use git --version in your terminal to check. If not installed, download and install from the official Git website.
2. Git clone this repository
In the terminal, navigate to the folder that you would like to store the UQ NeuroTech vault. Then run the following command: `git clone https://github.com/UQNeuroTech/vault.git`
At this point, you will have all of the raw text files on your own computer. You can stop here and use any text, or markdown editor of your choosing. 
3. Install the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes app.
4. Open the *vault* folder (that you just cloned) as an Obsidian vault, in the Obsidian app.
5. Navigate to the setting and ensure that the "Obsidian Git" plugin is installed and has the correct settings
6. Click on the *index* note to get started!
7. This is the end of the installation instructions for now. But they will be added to and made more clear in the future as this repository grows. Check out this guide for some extra guidance that might be usefull: [How to sync an Obsidian vault with GitHub using the Obsidian Git plugin](https://eightify.app/media/how-to-sync-an-obsidian-vault-with-github-using-the-obsidian#autosync-a-user-friendly-approach).
